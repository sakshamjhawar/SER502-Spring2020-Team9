Milestone 1 Contributions:Design discussion and features to include:Each team member participated in design discussion and together we decided all the features of our language.Generating grammar for the language (Abhinaw Sarang):Wrote initial grammar in basic text format, then modified it to create EBNF format grammar. EBNF format is required by the tool we will be using for lexer and parser. Further enhanced the grammar as issues got discovered while testing the grammar. Both formats of grammar are available in the design document.Future Contributions:Lexer and Parser using LARK (Abhinaw Sarang):Will be working on developing lexer and parser in Python using the LARK library. This will read the input program file and output a meaningful syntax tree.Writing sample programs and testing:Each team member will work on this.
